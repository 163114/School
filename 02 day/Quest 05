## How to create a personal repository with the correct .gitignore and simple README.MD:
_Because of their larger potential in GitLab, repositories are called projects. But you can use the words interchangeably because a project behaves the same way as a repository you might find on GitHub._
------
1. Go to your Projects page and click _New project_.
